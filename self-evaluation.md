# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

  - I feel confident and fluent.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

  - I enjoy the practice of finding knowledge and tools outside the curriculum. Some aspects of reading documentation and others work is still intimidating but it continues to get better.


- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

  - More repetitions to really engrain the syntax will be helpful. I already have time scheduled for activities like this.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  - None at the moment.
